            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Make and chill the patty mixture:</h5>
                    <p>In a food processor, add the chickpeas, grated carrot, garlic, and spices. Pulse the mixture a few times until combined into a rough paste. Add the egg and breadcrumbs, and pulse a few more times until mixture is evenly mixed.</p>
                    <p>Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, and chill for at least an hour or up to 24 hours. Chilling helps the mixture hold together a little better when forming the patties and when grilling.</p>
                    <p>Patties can also be shaped and grilled immediately, but will be fairly delicate. We recommend using a grill pan to grill the patties.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Shape the patties:</h5>
                    <p>Divide burger mixture into six even patties, and transfer to a plate or sheet pan to make it easy to carry to the grill. If you're not grilling right away, loosely cover the patties and store in the refrigerator until you're ready to grill.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Make the Green Goddess Sauce:</h5>
                    <p>Combine all ingredients for the sauce in a food processor with the blade attachment. Process until the sauce is smooth, has a uniform color, and an even consistency. It should be thick enough to hold its shape on a spoon. Taste the sauce and season to your liking with salt and pepper.</p>
                    <p>This sauce can also be made a few days ahead and kept refrigerated.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Prep all other burger ingredients:</h5>
                    <p>Make sure your burger buns, lettuce, sliced onion, and cheese are all prepped and arranged near the grill.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Preheat the grill:</h5>
                    <p>Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to direct medium-high heat. Prep all other burger ingredients (lettuce, red onion, cheese).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Grill the burgers:</h5>
                    <p>When you’re ready to cook burgers, lightly oil the grill grates or a grill pan with canola oil.</p>
                    <p>Grill burgers for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until a crust forms on the outside. If you’re using cheese, add sliced cheese in the last minute of grilling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Serve:</h5>
                    <p>Serve the burgers immediately with fresh lettuce, red onion, and slathered with the Green Goddess sauce.</p>
                    <p>Cooked burgers will keep well in the fridge for 4 to 5 days and uncooked burgers should be cooked within a day or two or frozen for later and then thawed before grilling.</p>
